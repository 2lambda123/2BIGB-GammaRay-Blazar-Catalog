# 2BIGB GammaRay Blazar Catalog 

2BIGB-arXiv: (https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.08912)

The 2BIGB catalog is a gamma-ray database which lists spectral data-points and the results of a broadband analysis with Fermi-LAT, for the entire population of high synchrotron peak blazars from the 3HSP catalog. 

The broadband analysis set up considers Pass8 data (P8R3) integrated over 11 years of observations, and the 0.5-500 GeV energy band. The results are available in the "2BIGB-3HSP-Broadband-500MeV-500GeV-11yrs.txt" file. The "README-Broadband-Results-Table.txt" file gives an extensive description of all columns.

The spectral data-points are calculated assuming superposed energy bins and consider Pass8 data (P8R3) integrated over 10.5 years of observations with Fermi-LAT (see paper for a complete description). The data-points are available in the "2BIGB-SED-to-upload-at-SSDC-ASI-SED-Tools-READ-V2.txt" file and are ready to upload at SSDC-ASI portal (https://tools.asdc.asi.it/SED/). The "README-2BIGB-GammaRay-SED-Data.txt" file gives a complete description of how to upload the data.

The SED data will also be available at OpenUniverse (http://www.openuniverse.asi.it/) and the Brazilian Science Data Center BSDC (http://bsdc.icranet.org/) portals.
